# CSL-Interpreter
Calculator Simple Language Interpreter - a small python interpreter that do mathematical calculations made with rply parser generator

**Note: This is my first attempt of creating an interpreter**

## What is CSL?
CSL (Calculator Simple Language) is a simple language that perform mathematical calculations `example : 7^6` returns 7 to the power of 6. It has some small operations like `log(x) and rad(x)`

## Downloading & Setting up CSL interpreter
To use the CSL interpreter download the production file which contains the python file and the windows interpreter ***"That runs CSL on windows on command line"*** 

Add the directory of the interpreter to  `%PATH%` 

## Using CSL interpreter
Now you can use the CSL interpreter using the following commands:

- interpret files:
```bash
> csli "filename"
```

- launch CSL interpreter:
```bash
> csli
```
you can use the example file `calculations.csl` to interpret it using CSL
